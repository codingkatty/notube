# NoTube
### An extension to save doomscrolling
Have you ever tried to do something, but decided to procrastinate through YouTube? Well, at least it has been a common issue for me. I would simply just open YouTube and get distracted. Its not a bad thing- it makes me happy, and I learn new stuff! But once I start, I can't really stop, and that's the problem.

## The Idea
I spend a lot of my time doomscrolling on YouTube shorts. So then, I thought, what if it can remind me of my tasks? So I came up with the following ideas:

- NoTube, complete blankness
- RemindTube, a gentle to-do/reminder that pops up
- PuzzleTube, you gotta solve puzzles to watch videos!
- LaterTube, a better wishlist so you don't need to immediately watch
- AiTube, video summarizer
- StudyTube, a mode that will make YouTube educational

They would all work together to create the ultimate YouTube!
